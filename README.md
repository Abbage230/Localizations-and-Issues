:Notes About Translations:

I've created a Crowdin project: https://crowdin.com/project/shetiphian-minecraft-mods

The account word limit though restricts me to 12-13 languages (while still leaving room for expanding current translations)

So I picked the seven I already had some translations for:
- de_de: German
- fr_fr: French
- it_it: Italian
- ko_kr: Korean
- pl_pl: Polish
- ru_ru: Russian
- zh_cn: Simplified/Mandarin Chinese

Except for Polish and Korean these are also in the top used languages, so the following my also end up being added:
- hi_in: Hindi
- es_es: Spanish
- ar_sa: Standard Arabic (apearently its not natively spoken but is widely understood thus used by all media)
- pt_pt: Portuguese
- id_id: Indonesian
- ja_jp: Japanese

Regional Dialects will not be on Crowdin but as with other missing languages, file submissions via pull request will be accepted.
