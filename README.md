:Notes About Translations:

I've created a Crowdin project: https://crowdin.com/project/shetiphian-minecraft-mods

From now on please use it rather then pull requests to submit changes.

I only added the languages I already had translations for.
So if you want to provide others just open a new 'issue' requesting it be added, or use a pull request to submit a new translation file.
I'll update the Crowdin with any new languages requested/submitted.
